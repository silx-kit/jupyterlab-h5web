/* The file format is set for the following reasons:
  - A model data is fetched by the core JupyterLab according to the file format.
  - If set to `text`, the fetching fails by raising an error "The file is not UTF-8 encoded"
  - If set to `base64`, it succeeds but no use of this data is made in the extension.
  - Indeed, the fetching of HDF5 is completely enclosed in the H5Web app. The file format should not be relevant.
As a result, this should be ideally changed for a cleaner solution that avoids fetching unnecessary data. */
