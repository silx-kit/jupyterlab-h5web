## Install

The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Move to jupyterlab-h5web directory

# Install server extension
pip install -e .
# Register server extension
jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyterlab_h5web --sys-prefix

# Install dependencies
jlpm
# Build Typescript source
jlpm build
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension install .
# Rebuild Typescript source after making changes
jlpm build
# Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changes
jupyter lab build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in another terminal tab
jlpm watch
# Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tab
jupyter lab --watch
```

Now every change will be built locally and bundled into JupyterLab. Be sure to refresh your browser page after saving file changes to reload the extension (note: you'll need to wait for webpack to finish, which can take 10s+ at times).

## Formatting

This extension uses `prettier` to format `*.ts` files and `black` to format `*.py` files.

## Uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlab_h5web
jupyter labextension uninstall jupyterlab-h5web
```
